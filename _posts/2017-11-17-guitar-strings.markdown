description: A static website I created as my first project while learning Web Development. Pressing any letter ('a'-'z') key or 1-4 plays a note on a guitar. 'z' plays an open bottom E-String and chromatically increases through x,c,v...a,s,d...q,w,e...1,2,3,4. I also added text you can follow along to play "Hall of the Mountain King". Used howler.js and paper.js for sounds and graphics respectively.<a href="https://guitar-strings.herokuapp.com/">Play around with it</a>
