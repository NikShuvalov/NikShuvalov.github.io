description: This was a 4-man group collaboration to create an App that utilized the Yelp Api. We also implemented Google Api to get the users location, the Uber Api to get price estimates to get to different from current location, and the Twitter Api. to share venues you find on twitter. The idea for the app is to expose the user to new restaurants. <a href="https://github.com/NikShuvalov/Project_3">GitHub Link to Project</a>
