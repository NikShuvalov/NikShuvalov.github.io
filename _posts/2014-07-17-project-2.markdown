description: This was a 4-man group collaboration to create an App that utilized the Yelp Api. We also implemented Google Api to get the users location, the Uber Api to get price estimates to get to different from current location, and the Twitter Api to share venues you find on twitter. The idea for the app is to expose the user to new restaurants. We did this by adding randomizing features to our app. The generic randomization returns 1 to 3 random restaurants based on search parameters. One of the other features does the same as the generic randomization but only returns ratings, pricing and locations of the restaurant. The idea for this was to have people commit to these places based purely on those parameters. The last feature is to build a date itinerary. The user starts off with a single venue, after selecting it, they can they add search for another venue of a different category (Museum, club, bar, etc) that's relatively near the first one. They can continue to add venues until finalizing, at which point every location is populated on a google map display.(Github repo for project)[https://github.com/NikShuvalov/Project_3]
